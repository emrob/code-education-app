        Before you write your code you need to think about the order it needs
        to be in. Think about when you get ready to go outside, you need to put
        your socks on before your shoes. If you put your shoes on before your
        socks that would be silly wouldnâ€™t it?! The same goes for code, the
        order of instructions is very important.
